        web development.
    </h2><br>
        Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves everything from web design to programming and database management. Web development is generally divided into three core areas: Frontend Development, Backend Development, and Full Stack Development.
        <br><br>
        <ul><li>Frontend Development</li><br>
         Frontend development refers to everything that users see and interact with on the website. It involves the design, structure, and layout of the website and is often referred to as the ‘client side’ of an application.<br>
        <br>
        <li>Backend Development</li><br>
         Backend development refers to the server side of a website, where the logic and data are processed and stored. Users do not directly interact with this part, but it ensures that the website works properly.

        <h2>app development</h2>
        Mobile app development is about designing and building applications specifically for mobile devices. Unlike desktop software, mobile apps are tailored to work on smaller screens, touch-based interfaces, and often limited processing power. Developers use programming languages like Swift for Apple’s iOS platform or Kotlin/Java for Android devices. The process involves multiple stages, from coming up with an idea to launching the app and keeping it updated. It combines creativity (like designing an attractive interface) with technical skills (like coding the app’s functionality) to create apps that users love.
         <br>Mobile app development covers several areas:<br>


        <br><lu>
            <li>
                User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) Design: Creating an app that’s easy to use and visually appealing.

            </li>
            <li>Backend Development: Building the server-side systems that power the app, like databases or cloud services.
             </li>
             <li>Quality Assurance (QA): Testing the app to ensure it works smoothly without bugs.
             </li>

        AI software development
    </h2>
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the software development landscape by introducing tools and techniques that enhance productivity, accuracy, and innovation. AI, particularly generative AI (gen AI) and large language models (LLMs), streamline the development cycle by automating key steps, from idea generation and requirement gathering to coding and testing.
